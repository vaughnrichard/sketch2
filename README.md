# Project Description

### Two branches
There are two branches of this project - the audio visualizer and physics simulation branches.
The audio visualizer is to be implemented at a later date. The plan - as of now - is to
visualize music with the spheres like the old itunes visualizer. The plan is to have the spheres
orbit the origin and pulse with the music, speeding up and slowing down with the energy of the music.

The physics simulator is a new idea of mine - one that this sketch will turn into in the immediate time
frame. It will shift to a "physics simulation" almost screensaver project. It will have spheres that interact
with each other on a "mass" and "electrical" attraction basis. Basically, at close distances the spheres will
repel each other while at large distances they will attract.

The idea is that many of the balls will be in the sphere, and their interactions will generate visually appealing
behavior.

Things that may be useful in this project:
* pull-back vector if the spheres get too far from the origin
* dampening factor if the balls begin going too large
